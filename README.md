# WCRnet
We propose a deep learning framework to estimate WCR using a cost-effective Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) sensor and a deep model, WCRnet, which leverages residual connections. This repository provides TensorFlow-Keras code for training and testing WCRnet with deep learning on the FDR sensor data, which represents the physical and electrical properties of mortar.

# 1. Clone Code
```c
git clone https://github.com/Hanyang-Robot/WCRnet.git
cd WCRnet/
```

# 2. Create Conda env
```c
conda env create -f wc_ratio.yaml
conda activate wc_ratio
```

# 3. Turn on Jupyter Notebook
```c
jupyter notebook
```
